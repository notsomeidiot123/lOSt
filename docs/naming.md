# Naming conventions in code

Fair warning, not all code follows these conventions, as these were only really standardized after a significant portion of the code was written

Naming is pretty simple. The variable names literally describe what they are (or what they're expected to be), the only confusing part is the last
portion of the name. Here's the table of suffixes and their appropriate meanings

|suffix | meaning|
|-------|--------|
|_p     |packed bitflags
|_t     |typedefed struct
|_s     |raw struct
|_c     |count
